    """
    Shared base for KNN-based DES algorithms.

    Handles score matrix construction and neighbor index fitting.
    Subclasses implement predict() with their own selection or weighting logic.

    The difference between DES algorithms (KNORA-E, KNORA-U, OLA, KNN-DWS, etc.)
    is purely in how they use the score matrix at predict time. The core loop —
    compute per-sample scores, store in matrix, fit neighbor index — is always
    the same and lives here.
